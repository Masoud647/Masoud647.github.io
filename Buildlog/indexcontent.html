		<H3>Introduction</H3>
		<p>The project I decide to work on is the Parts crib database. 
			The reason why I choose this project is because I felt like it met all my capabilities. 
			The purpose of this project is to create a quick and efficient way to take out items from the parts and store them in a database.
			The group members I decided to work with on this project are Rafel Yashooa, Divesh Oree and Gurpreet Jhita.

		<p>The humber parts crib database project functionality is to be able to scan barcodes on student id cards and the associated part items from the parts crib and then be placed in a database. 
		Now understanding what the concept of the humber part crib database project is, the system diagram can be easily interpreted.

		<p>
			The main materials/components required for my project are a raspberry pi, webcam and barcodes. 
			Added features/materials are PCB for light indicator, sound bar and acrylic box. 
			The PCB and acrylic box were both provided by the school. In addition, the raspberry pi requires a monitor, keyboard and mouse to be setup. 
			My budget was fairly simple and not expensive except for the raspberry pi kit. My full excel version of my budget is provided in my GitHub page.
