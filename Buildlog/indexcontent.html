		<H3>Introduction</H3>
		<p>The project I decide to work on is the Parts crib database. 
			The reason why I choose this project is because I felt like it met all my capabilities. 
			The purpose of this project is to create a quick and efficient way to take out items from the parts and store them in a database.
			The group members I decided to work with on this project are Rafel Yashooa, Divesh Oree and Gurpreet Jhita.

		<H3>System Diagram</H3>
		<p>The humber parts crib database project functionality is to be able to scan barcodes on student id cards and the associated part items from the parts crib and then be placed in a database. 
		Now understanding what the concept of the humber part crib database project is, the system diagram can be easily interpreted.

		<H3>Bill of Materials/Budget</H3>
		<p>
			The main materials/components required for my project are a raspberry pi, webcam and barcodes. 
			Added features/materials are PCB for light indicator, sound bar and acrylic box. 
			The PCB and acrylic box were both provided by the school. In addition, the raspberry pi requires a monitor, keyboard and mouse to be setup. 
			My budget was fairly simple and not expensive except for the raspberry pi kit. My full excel version of my budget is provided in my GitHub page.

		<H3>Time Commitment</H3>
		<p>The time commitment for my project took about 15 weeks to complete in its entirety. 
			Firstly, the project began with ordering parts through websites like amazon, eBay and all sorts of technology base websites. Once ordered, 
			the delivery took about week and a half (week 2 & 3) to come in. As everything arrived, 
			I then began to setup my raspberry pi and all of its components which took my about 1 hour to setup.
			As week 5 approached I printed out my PCB and started soldering everything. 
			The soldering approximately took me about 2 hours to complete at school. 
			Afterward, at week 6 and week 7 I started to test my raspberry pi and its components which took me about 6 hours in its entirety. 
			Firstly, I tested if the PCB by implementing the code given by the teacher that can test if the lights work and the sensors. 
			Then I started implementing the code in which will scan barcodes with my webcam which then again took me about 5 hours to complete. 
			Next, during week 9 I created I remote desktop with my raspberry pi and laptop so I could connect it remotely without using an external monitor, keyboard and mouse.  
			Lastly, during week 12 and 13 I began and created my acrylic box, the box design took me about 1 hour to complete and the lazar cut took about 20 minutes. 
			Here at the bottom is all the task I completed and will be easier to understand.</p>

		<H3>Mechanical Assembly</H3>
		<p>The assembly of my project is very simple first connect the PCB on top of the raspberry pi which contains the light indicator. 
			Secondly, proceed and connect the webcam to the USB port on the raspberry pi and then lastly connect the raspberry pi to a power outlet. 
			And thatâ€™s how to Assembly all the parts of my project.

			<H3>PCB / Soldering</H3>
			<p>Humber college provided us with a PCB which is called the Modular Sensor Hat. The PCB contains 20 pin GPIO header, two 4 pin header, 5 pin header, a couple of resistors, transistors and a light.
				Before soldering I took care of my safety by wearing my safety glasses and making sure my work place was clear. 
				The soldering was fairly simple to complete because of the schematic which outlined where everything goes.
