Executive Summary
-----------------

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for **Parts Crib Database**. The database will
**store information of students whom rent out items from the parts crib**. The
mobile device functionality will include **list amount of each item in the parts
crib and how many are left after being rented out and** will be further detailed
in the mobile application proposal. I will be collaborating with the following
company/department **Humber College Information Technology**. In the winter
semester I plan to form a group with the following students, who are also
building similar hardware this term and working on the mobile application with
me are **Rafil Yashooa and Divesh Oree**. The hardware will be completed in CENG
317 Hardware Production Techniques independently and the application will be
completed in CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together in the
subsequent term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3
student group.

Background
----------

The problem solved by project is it will improve the efficiency of students
taking out items from the parts crib. This project will connect to a database
and keep track of students with their full names, student numbers and items.
There will be bar codes for each items in the parts crib that will be linked to
the database that contains every item in the parts crib. When a student takes
out items from the parts crib their card will be scanned with the items that are
taken out. This will put the students in the list(database) of students who
taken out items from the parts crib. This will intern keep track of all items
taken out and help keep everything organized. The application (app) then will be
used to list all the items available in the parts crib and will be available to
all students in the campus. The app will be presented in a listed form that will
have detailed information of the items in the parts crib and help students know
which item to take out.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read [2] which provides insight into
similar efforts.

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

Methodology
-----------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Introduction/Overview
---------------------

The main point of this project is to create a new parts crib system that is more
efficient and more advanced than just using paper slips to sign out item from
the crib. What I have in mind for the project is to create a barcode scanner
using either a web cam or either a laser scanner (if we can afford one) to scan
student numbers and items that will be checked out by the students.

So, when a student comes to the parts crib for an item, they will be assigned a
barcode will their student number if it’s their first time coming and then
they’ll be ready for item take out. All the administrator has to do then is to
scan the student number and then start scanning then items that that user
requested as they will each have a barcode. After the scanning is done, the user
is ready to go and their student number will be stored in the local database on
the raspberry pi.

The barcode scanned will be processed by the raspberry pI which will store it on
the SQL database and then the application fetches from the database and displays
the information. Note: only administrators will be able to view the student
numbers, regular users will only be able to view the inventory count of items in
the crib.

System Requirements Specifications
----------------------------------

The goal of this project is to create a better system for the Humber part’s crib
system. It is a more organized way of signing in and out items. This application
is going to receive data from a raspberry pi that will be used as our hardware
device located in the parts crib. The user has to first scan the student id and
that is recognized by the first ‘n’ character. And then scan the part number
which will be

Hardware present
----------------

The Humber parts crib is a project that will be able to keep track of students
who take out and return items from the crib. This will occur because of three
main hardware components; the raspberry pi, a camera, and barcodes. The
raspberry pi is basically single-board computer which will be the brains of the
project by computing and keeping track of all the student’s activity in the
parts crib by using the code/program implement by us the developers. Secondly,
the camera, an important hardware component because it will be used to scan
items in the parts crib which then will be sent to the raspberry pi. Lastly, the
paper barcodes will be used to identify the items in the parts crib when scanned
by the camera. In addition, the Humber parts crib project will have additional
hardware components such as LED lights to notify when an item is scanned or when
it is unable to be scanned and there will also be a sound bar implementing the
LED characteristics but with sound.

identified by a ‘p’ character. Every item that the user will scan will go under
the student’s name for check out which will go to a database stored in the
raspberry pi.

This application is designed for an android device. This project also cannot
work offline due to the database being a huge part of the hardware aspect.
However, internet availability in the college is very static and will no need to
be offline at anytime

Workload Breakdown
------------------

As for the work breakdown, I (Rafil Yashooa) will be working with the database
and connect the hardware aspect and software to an online server. As for Divesh
Oree and Masoud Rahguzar they will be improving the design of the hardware and
software by printing and soldering a PCB to fit the speaker and LED light in
order to have a more elegant design, they will also be working on the software
application just to make sure there are no bugs and improve the design interface
to make the application more user friendly.

Database & work breakdown identified
------------------------------------

For our capstone project this term, we are building a PartCrib system which
hopefully be successful enough to be used by the Humber’s parts crib department.
This project consists of 2 major parts, hardware and software. And in order to
have the hardware interact with the software, we need them both to be connected
to the same database so that one can send data and the other receive data, and
vise versa.

The hardware part of this project is going to act as a scanner to scan barcode
items and student id barcode. After it scan them successfully, the database
would create a table for each student id it scans with a row of the exact time
stamp and part number. Students would be able to sign out multiple items at once
since the table can handle many rows under it.

The software part would be the project’s android application and it would
retrieve data from the database and display it live to the application. The data
it retrieves would be based on the user’s privilege, if it was an administrator
using the app, it would display the full database with the student numbers and
part numbers. But if it was only a guest browsing the app, it would only display
the inventory with the items available in stock to sign out.

For the database, we are going to be using an SQL based service, the database we
have up and running right now is firebase which doesn’t allow full access to
retrieve data to the application. We are either going to find a solution for
this or use an SQL server running on another computer which is going to be port
forwarded from home.

Application & Work Breakdown
----------------------------

The application for the Humber parts crib is an interactive, simple and
user-friendly app (available only on android) that has the potential of being
very useful for students at Humber. The app will consist of two types of users,
the first being the student user and the second being the administrator. The
student users in the app will only have access to the inventory status of the
items in the parts crib. The administrator users will have a username and
password that will give them access to everything in the app such as inventory
status, database, add items and delete items. The way the app will continuously
update the inventory status is by the use of a database program called firebase.

The work break down will consist of three sections the first is the database,
the second is the design and the last section is bug fixes. Rafil Yashooa will
be responsible for the database which he will connect the app and the hardware
together to work seamlessly together. Masoud Rahguzar will be responsible for
the design of the app by making it user-friendly and functional. Lastly, Divesh
Oree will be responsible for bug fixes on the app, searching issues occurring in
the app.

Database with Web Interface
---------------------------

For our Humber Part Crib project, our web interface will be designed using a
two-tier architecture where the administrator will communicate and interact with
a server. The web application will be based on a Java platform where it will
communicate directly with a firebase database by using the appropriate Java
Database Connectivity API. The latter will use his credentials that is his email
address and password in order to log in. Inside the database, the administrator
will have the privilege to check all the items available in the inventory,
remove a student once the items have been returned, and also add a new student
with the item parts which are being signed out from the crib.

As the database, will be connected on the Humber Server, we expect the wireless
internet connection to be fast enough and is connected to the right access point
so that the administrator can perform his daily task without any difficulty and
hence making this whole project an effective one.
