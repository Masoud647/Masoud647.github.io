Executive Summary
-----------------

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, We will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for **Parts Crib Database**. The database will
**store information of students who sign out items from the parts crib**. The
mobile device functionality will include **list amount of each item in the parts
crib and how many are left after being sign out and** will be further detailed
in the mobile application proposal. We will be collaborating with the following
company/department **Humber College Information Technology**. In the winter
semester we plan to form a group with the following students, who are also
building similar hardware this term and working on the mobile application with
the following group members **Masoud Rahguzar, Rafil Yashooa and Divesh Oree**.
The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques
independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software
Project.

Background
----------

The problem solved by project is it will improve the efficiency of students
taking out items from the parts crib. This project will connect to a database
and keep track of students with their full names, student numbers and items.
There will be bar codes for each items in the parts crib that will be linked to
the database that contains every item in the parts crib. When a student takes
out items from the parts crib their card will be scanned with the items that are
taken out. This will put the students in the list(database) of students who
taken out items from the parts crib. This will intern keep track of all items
taken out and help keep everything organized. The mobile application then will
be used to list all the items available in the parts crib and will be available
to all students in the campus. The mobile application will be presented in a
listed form that will have detailed information of the items in the parts crib
and help students know which item to take out.

We have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read which provides insight into similar
efforts.[@7374231; @5635329; @810282]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable us to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as our capstone project.

Methodology
-----------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. Our coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Concluding remarks
------------------

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for Parts Crib. This
is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our program
to create a collaborative IoT capstone project demonstrating my ability to learn
how to support projects such as the initiative described by our group, Humber
parts crib. We request approval of this project.

Abstract
--------

The reason for this project is to develop a new parts crib system that is
efficient and reliable, instead of the present way of using paper slips that are
used to sign out items. The parts crib is an area that is used for technology
students at Humber who can sign out hardware items that can be useful for labs
and projects which is very useful. Our project will consist of three major
hardware parts the Raspberry pi, webcam and barcodes. Raspberry Pi is the brain
of the operation computing and processing all the actives in the parts crib. The
webcam is the eyes of the operation by scanning the barcodes. Lastly, the
barcodes hold the information to identify each item in the parts crib and
students who take out items. All information will be fetched to a database that
will categorized using firebase. The database will be working along with our app
and website, these applications will be used for showing the inventory status of
the parts crib. In addition, the applications will also be used for the
administrator (individual who works at the parts crib.) whom will have
additional options to manipulate the inventory status and the students who took
out items. This is brief description of our project.

=====================

1. Introduction/Overview
========================

The main point of this project is to create a new parts crib system that is more
efficient and more advanced than just using paper slips to sign out item from
the crib. What we have in mind for the project is to create a barcode scanner
using either a web cam or either a laser scanner (if we can afford one) to scan
student numbers and items that will be checked out by the students.

So, when a student comes to the parts crib for an item, they will be assigned a
barcode will their student number if it’s their first time coming and then
they’ll be ready for item take out. All the administrator has to do then is to
scan the student number and then start scanning then items that that user
requested as they will each have a barcode. After the scanning is done, the user
is ready to go and their student number will be stored in the local database on
the raspberry pi.

The barcode scanned will be processed by the Raspberry Pi which will store it on
the SQL database and then the application fetches from the database and displays
the information. Note: only administrators will be able to view the student
numbers, regular users will only be able to view the inventory count of items in
the crib.

2. System Requirements Specifications
=====================================

The goal of this project is to create a better system for the Humber part’s crib
system. It is a more organized way of signing in and out items. This application
is going to receive data from a Raspberry Pi that will be used as our hardware
device located in the parts crib. The user has to first scan the student id and
that is recognized by the first ‘n’ character. And then scan the part number
which will be identified by a ‘p’ character. Every item that the user will scan
will go under the student’s name for check out which will go to a database
stored in the raspberry pi.

This application is designed for an android device. This project also cannot
work offline due to the database being a huge part of the hardware aspect.
However, internet availability in the college is very static and will no need to
be offline at anytime

2.1.1 Purpose
-------------

This project is a collaboration of the Humber Parts Crib which will allows
students to sign off items for their labs on regular basis. Our main objective
and goal is to make the Humber Parts Crib more effective by using cutting edge
technologies.

2.1.2 Product Overview
----------------------

The main product that we will be using is a Raspberry Pi 3, a camera, a
well-designed PCB with the LEDs and speaker mounted on it. All of these
component will be assembled inside a case for the safety and provide a better
presentation of the project.

2.1.3 Targeted Audience Group
-----------------------------

The main targeted audience group will be the students studying at Humber
College, mostly in engineering programs. The administrator will obviously have
to be a staff of the college in order to be able to use it. This device will
allow students to sign parts much quicker and help us to reduce the usage of
paper.

2.2 Product Information
-----------------------

2.2.1 Main Functionality
------------------------

The functionality is pretty simple. Basically, we will have a camera which we
will use in order to scan the barcode strip on the student card and that barcode
information will be processed by the raspberry pi 3 and will get input
electronically in the system. On the new custom made PCB, we will mount a
speaker and the LEDs which will allow the user to recognize if the barcode got
scanned successfully or not.

2.2.2 Extra Requirements
------------------------

In order to be able to use the device and have access to the database web
interface, it is important that we have internet connection as everything will
be connected on a server. As an extra requirement, we might use an RF scanner
(we are planning on discussing with our Professor first before moving forward)
in order to speed up the scanning of barcodes.

2.2.3 Best Performance
----------------------

As stated above, we will mount both the LEDs and the speaker on a newly designed
PCB instead of having them connected separately. The LEDs will toggle a green
light if scanning is successful and then red if unsuccessful. The speaker will
produce a “beep” sound which will allow the admin to recognize whether the
barcode got scanned or not. We also decided that we will consider designing,
building a stand and attaching it to the case which will hold the student card
in order to provide a best performance when it comes to scanning the barcode.

2.3 Overall Description
=======================

2.3.1 Database
--------------

For our capstone project this term, we are building a PartCrib system which
hopefully be successful enough to be used by the Humber’s parts crib department.
This project consists of 2 major parts, hardware and software. And in order to
have the hardware interact with the software, we need them both to be connected
to the same database so that one can send data and the other receive data, and
vise versa.

The hardware part of this project is going to act as a scanner to scan barcode
items and student id barcode. After it scan them successfully, the database
would create a table for each student id it scans with a row of the exact time
stamp and part number. Students would be able to sign out multiple items at once
since the table can handle many rows under it.

The software part would be the project’s android application and it would
retrieve data from the database and display it live to the application. The data
it retrieves would be based on the user’s privilege, if it was an administrator
using the app, it would display the full database with the student numbers and
part numbers. But if it was only a guest browsing the app, it would only display
the inventory with the items available in stock to sign out.

For the database, we are going to be using an SQL based service, the database we
have up and running right now is firebase which doesn’t allow full access to
retrieve data to the application. We are either going to find a solution for
this or use an SQL server running on another computer which is going to be port
forwarded from home.

2.3.2 Hardware
--------------

The Humber parts crib is a project that will be able to keep track of students
who take out and return items from the crib. This will occur because of three
main hardware components; the raspberry pi, a camera, and barcodes. The
raspberry pi is basically single-board computer which will be the brains of the
project by computing and keeping track of all the student’s activity in the
parts crib by using the code/program implement by us the developers. Secondly,
the camera, an important hardware component because it will be used to scan
items in the parts crib which then will be sent to the raspberry pi. Lastly, the
paper barcodes will be used to identify the items in the parts crib when scanned
by the camera. In addition, the Humber parts crib project will have additional
hardware components such as LED lights to notify when an item is scanned or when
it is unable to be scanned and there will also be a sound bar implementing the
LED characteristics but with sound.

identified by a ‘p’ character. Every item that the user will scan will go under
the student’s name for check out which will go to a database stored in the
raspberry pi.

This application is designed for an android device. This project also cannot
work offline due to the database being a huge part of the hardware aspect.
However, internet availability in the college is very static and will no need to
be offline at anytime

2.3.3 Application
-----------------

The application for the Humber parts crib is an interactive, simple and
user-friendly app (available only on android) that has the potential of being
very useful for students at Humber. The app will consist of two types of users,
the first being the student user and the second being the administrator. The
student users in the app will only have access to the inventory status of the
items in the parts crib. The administrator users will have a username and
password that will give them access to everything in the app such as inventory
status, database, add items and delete items. The way the app will continuously
update the inventory status is by the use of a database program called firebase.

2.3.4 Database with Web Interface
---------------------------------

For our Humber Part Crib project, our web interface will be designed using a
two-tier architecture where the administrator will communicate and interact with
a server. The web application will be based on a Java platform where it will
communicate directly with a firebase database by using the appropriate Java
Database Connectivity API. The latter will use his credentials that is his email
address and password in order to log in. Inside the database, the administrator
will have the privilege to check all the items available in the inventory,
remove a student once the items have been returned, and also add a new student
with the item parts which are being signed out from the crib.

As the database, will be connected on the Humber Server, we expect the wireless
internet connection to be fast enough and is connected to the right access point
so that the administrator can perform his daily task without any difficulty and
hence making this whole project an effective one.

2.4 Future Considerations
=========================

2.4.1 Operating Environment
---------------------------

In order to be able to use this device, you will need a system which is
connected to a rapid internet connection.

2.4.2 Safety Considerations
---------------------------

Safety precautions to take into consideration:

-   Protect the device from any liquid exposure and always wear safety glasses

-   Check your connections first before powering the raspberry Pi

-   Always have your username and password , in order to have access to the
    database web interface

-   Remember to sign students off after they return the parts in order to avoid
    database stack overflow

2.4.3 Future Additions
----------------------

We might consider on designing and cutting out a new acrylic case as the
previous one that we made was a bit too big. Also, as mentioned above regarding
the RF scanner, we will make the stand first and see how it works.

2.4.4 Workload Breakdown
------------------------

The work break down will consist of three sections the first is the database,
the second is the hardware and the last section is software. Rafil Yashooa will
be responsible for the database which he will connected to the website
application and the hardware to work seamlessly together. Masoud Rahguzar will
be responsible for the hardware, printing a PCB which will connect the speaker
to the Raspberry Pi, Acrylic case using corel draw and many other aspects in the
hardware. Lastly, Divesh Oree will be updating and improving the mobile
application for inventory use.

2.5 Build Instructions
----------------------

2.5.1 Introduction
------------------

This build log instructions will help students replicate our project for future
use, We will describe and show step by step instructions on how to do so. The
group members who participated to create this project are Masoud Rahguzar, Rafil
Yashooa, Divesh Oree and felt like it was their duty to make a better system to
take out parts from the parts crib.

The main point of this project is to create a new parts crib system that is more
efficient and more advanced than just using paper slips to sign out item from
the crib. What we have in mind for the project is to create a barcode scanner
using either a web cam or either a laser scanner (if we can afford one) to scan
student numbers and items that will be checked out by the students.

So when a student comes to the parts crib for an item, they will be assigned a
barcode will their student number if its their first time coming and then
they’ll be ready for item take out. All the administrator has to do then is to
scan the student number and then start scanning then items that that user
requested as they will each have a barcode. After the scanning is done, the user
is ready to go and their student number will be stored in the local database on
the raspberry pi.

2.5.2 System Diagram
--------------------

The humber parts crib database project functionality is to be able to scan
barcodes on student id cards and the associated part items from the parts crib
and then be placed in a database. Now understanding what the concept of the
humber part crib database project is, the system diagram can be easily
interpreted.

2.5.3 Bill of Materials/Budget
------------------------------

The main materials/components required for our project are a raspberry pi,
webcam and barcodes. Added features/materials are PCB for light indicator, sound
bar and acrylic box. The PCB and acrylic box were both provided by the school.
In addition, the raspberry pi requires a monitor, keyboard and mouse to be
setup. Our budget was fairly simple and not expensive except for the raspberry
pi kit. Our full excel version of our budget is provided in our GitHub page.

### 2.5.4 Time Commitment

The time commitment for our project took about 15 weeks to complete in its
entirety. Firstly, the project began with ordering parts through websites like
amazon, eBay and all sorts of technology base websites. Once ordered, the
delivery took about week and a half (week 2 & 3) to come in. As everything
arrived, we then began to setup our Raspberry Pi and all of its components which
took about 1 hour to setup. As week 5 approached we printed out the PCB and
started soldering everything. The soldering approximately took me about 2 hours
to complete at school. Afterward, at week 6 and week 7 we started to test the
raspberry pi and its components which took us about 6 hours in its entirety.
Firstly, we tested if the PCB by implementing the code given by the teacher that
can test if the lights work and the sensors. Then we started implementing the
code in which will scan barcodes with our webcam which then again took me about
5 hours to complete. Next, during week 9 we created the remote desktop with the
raspberry pi and laptop so we could connect it remotely without using an
external monitor, keyboard and mouse. Lastly, during week 12 and 13 we began and
created our acrylic box, the box design took about 1 hour to complete and the
lazar cut took about 20 minutes. Here at the bottom is all the task we completed
and will be easier to understand.

**Time Commitment Schedule:**

| **Tasks**                 | **Time Required**         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Ordering Parts & Delivery | 2 Weeks                   |
| Raspberry Pi Setup        | 1 hour                    |
| PCB Soldering             | 2 hours                   |
| Testing PCB               | 1 hour                    |
| Coding                    | 5 hours in span of 4 days |
| Remote Desktop            | 1 hour                    |
| Mechanical Assembly       | 15 minutes                |
| Designing acrylic box     | 2 hours                   |
| Laser Cutting             | 15-30 minutes             |

2.5.5 Mechanical Assembly
-------------------------

The assembly of our project is very simple first connect the PCB on top of the
raspberry pi which contains the light indicator. Secondly, proceed and connect
the webcam to the USB port on the raspberry pi and then lastly connect the
raspberry pi to a power outlet. And that’s how to Assembly all the parts of our
project.

2.5.6 PCB / Soldering
---------------------

Humber college provided us with a PCB which is called the Modular Sensor Hat.
The PCB contains 20 pin GPIO header, two 4 pin header, 5 pin header, a couple of
resistors, transistors and a light. Before soldering, we took care of safety by
wearing safety glasses and make sure the workplace is clear. The soldering was
fairly simple to complete because of the schematic which outlined where
everything goes.

*Image 3: Displays the PCB and all its glory*

**Easy Steps to follow**

When you start up a Raspberry Pi, you should always start with updating it by
using these commands: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade.

You’ll want to do this as your Raspberry Pi will get the latest patches and
updates from the developers.

First of all, you’ll need to install python and the python/zbar library using
the following commands:

sudo apt-get install python-dev

sudo apt-get install python-pip

Next, you’ll need to install pillow

sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo apt-get install python-httplib2

After, go ahead and download the zbar library from this github
account:[Here](https://github.com/npinchot/zbar)

Click on “Clone Or download” and you should see it start downloading

After that, use the unzip command to extract the folder and the cd into the
folder.

After you’re in the folder, execute the following command: python setup.py
install –user

If everything was done right, you should get no errors and the files should be
extracted.

After that, use the code that that is provided in the downloads bellow and
download all the downloads as they all link to each other.

After downloading all the files, you’ll need to compile the red\_light.c,
green\_light.c and also softTone.c

Compiling them using: gcc –Wall –o executable name c\_file.c – lwiringPi

Where ‘executable name’ is the name of the executable you’ll want them to be,
‘c\_file.c’ is the source file. NOTE: make sure the executable names are the
same as the ones in the bar\_code.py file as they will be called from there.

If everything is done right, you should be able to run and scan a barcode, when
it successfully scans the barcode, you should notice the light turning green and
the beep audio sound coming from the speaker, after it scans it, you should be
able to see the created file called student\_number.txt which will contain the
stored student numbers.

2.5.7 Unit Testing
------------------

The uniting testing begins the PCB as mentioned in the power up. It is
recommended to use the code that is given by Humber College or at the GitHub
page to test if the light indicator works. The light indictor can work with the
command “sudo./traffic2B” if the code is there. The next step is to check if the
webcam work. This can be done by installing FSWEBCAM by putting “sudo apt-get
install fswebcam” in the command line of the terminal which will install an easy
way to check if the camera works. Once installed type “fswebcam image.jpg” in
the command line and if it takes a picture with good quality the webcam works.
After this, the code created for this project can be used which is in the GitHub
page. The program can run by typing “python bar\_code.py” in the command line.

2.5.8 Production Testing
------------------------

The production testing is fairly simple. Run the barcode program bar\_code.py
and place a barcode in front of the webcam. In addition, focus the webcam
(manually if needed) so that it can quickly scan the barcode. Once scanned the
barcode will be place in a txt file and in the terminal it can display the txt
file by typing for example “cat nameoftxt.txt”.

2.6 Progress Reports
--------------------

Progress Report

At this moment on week 4, we are supposed to handle in our progress report
stating the progress of the whole project.  On Week 2, we submitted our proposal
and port it into Markdown and the two relevant pages printed out, the one with
the inline citations and one with the references list. On week 3, we submitted
our SRS (Requirement specification) which included the following sections:

1.  Hardware present

2.  Skeleton with SRS completed

3.  Database and work breakdown

4.  Application and work breakdown

5.  Web and web breakdown 

As of week 4 we are all on track according to our project schedule, we have
started working on the web application for our project, the application is
connected to a firebase server and currently has the functionality of fetching
live data from the database. The application has 3 main functionalities, ‘sign
out item’ which lets the administrator scan student ids and the part numbers. A
‘Return Item’ which lets the administrator scan or manually input the student id
and then ability to return parts all at once. And finally a ‘View database’
button which lets the admin access the full database with all the current
holdings, it also tells you the number of people that have items signed out in
total and a search option which is a work of progress as of right now. The
application was build using HTML, JavaScript and JSP for the login credentials.

As for the problems we encountered, the search option still does not work
properly, it only displays the last item in the database list and doesn’t find a
result for the entries above. I’m hoping to fix sometime tomorrow or at the end
of this day. The next step is to insert data from the raspberry pi into the
database and them after, fetch that data and use it for the following
functionalities.

We have not exceeded our financial status as our project consists of only
programming for this stage.

3. Conclusions
==============

The project, Humber Parts Crib has been created to keep track of all items in
the parts crib when items are lent out and returned back. The Humber Parts Crib
consists of a camera, raspberry pi, PCB (speaker & lights) and a case. This
project intern will be able to scan barcodes representing the students and
items. The data will be placed in a database called firebase using the website
application which will be fetched by the mobile application. The mobile
application will be able to display the inventory status of the parts crib,
helping students determine if there is an item they want in the parts crib. The
website application will contain the administrative tools/control to be able to
lend out and return items which will be used by the employee at the parts crib.

4. Recommendations
==================

Throughout the creation process of our project there are recommendations that
could be made if reproduced again.  The first being the web camera, having a
better web camera will help accelerate the speed at which barcodes are scanned,
thus increasing the performance. In addition, having small web camera can allow
for a smaller and compact case which can be much portable if need. Secondly, ?
